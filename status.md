Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have built the structure for all of the integral parts of the site, including the homepage, the gallery, the "about us" page, and the history page, and, as part of this structure, I have inserted rotating pictures on the homepage, a dynamic photograph selection with lightboxes for each photo in the gallery, and a navigation bar at the top of the screen that can bring the user to each page of the website. I have found the components and tutorials offered through Bootstrap documentation and on the w3schools website especially helpful, as I worked on building these features. In addition to the basic structure, I have completed the task mentioned in my proposal that I knew I definitely wanted to complete: having a feature to allow the user to search for a keyword and then receive a gallery of photos related to that word. I did this by using SQLite and creating two tables, one that contained the picture name, caption, and file name, and another that included picture names and tags that belong to each individual picture.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The tasks I have left to finish for my project are to add additional aesthetic features to make the website look more visually interesting and professional, to finish documenting each picture so that I can upload their information to my database tables, and to add a registration page to "register" for photography classes. Hopefully, I will also have time to complete my "best case scenario" from the proposal (which involved making a store to "buy" photos), although I am unsure whether I will have time to finish that goal before the deadline.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

One of the largest problems I have encountered so far is that my HTML code does not recognize Apple's .HEIC file format for pictures, therefore for each picture I must open it individually in my computer's photo editor and save a copy as a .jpg file. Although this is not difficult, it is time consuming, as the process took me over an hour to copy about 90 photos. The other more significant difficulty I have had was getting the lightboxes for each photo to function properly (I ran into problems with sizing the photos correctly), but I have successfully gotten this feature to work.
