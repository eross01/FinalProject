# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to learn and become comfortable with HTTP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I am planning on completing a website project. Some of my general ideas for this project are an online registration system for classes, a website to showcase photographs with fake buying capabilities, or possibly a combination of both these ideas, time allowing. For the combination project, I would set up a website for a fake photography business that allowed people to view a gallery of photos, choose photographs to buy, and register for classes to learn the photography techniques used by the website artists. As I work my way through the website track, my backup plan (if I decide I do not want to build a website) is to make a game, possibly recreating and adding additional features to Frogger.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am planning to work alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I have a few questions:<br />
What are some examples of website ideas that would be A level projects?<br />
What are some resources you recommend as we begin this project?<br />
Do you recommend using Visual Studio Code for this project?
